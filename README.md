## PromiseHS

A play on the classic sliding-ice-block style puzzles, with an inside programming joke.

PromiseHS was built as a hackathon-esque project over ~ 4 days (2+ research!!) using basic Express for the server, React to serve the instructions, and PixiJS for the game canvas.

## Future add-ons

- isometry or other map design
- mobile controls
- set maps for true puzzles
- save/load
- loading screen
- lose/ level choice/ winning screens
- better UI
